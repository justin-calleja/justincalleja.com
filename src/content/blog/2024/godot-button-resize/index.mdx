## TextureButton?

If you add a `TextureButton` to a scene and try filtering out it's properties for "text"… you won't find anything.

If you don't need the button to resize i.e. if you don't have dynamic text content (e.g. changing text translation etc…), then using a `TextureButton` with a `MarginContainer` + `Label` inside it is an alternative to the approach below. That was how I initially attempted to solve this problem (not having "text" in a `TextureButton`) but I spent too much time trying to get the resizing to work and wasn't happy with adding custom code for something which seems like too common a use-case to not have a better approach.

## Button

Using a [Button](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_button.html) instead of a [TextureButton](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_texturebutton.html) gives us a "text" property to work with… built-in to the `Button` and - when changing this "text" property - the `Button` will resize itself.

The problem then is how to get back these convenient textures per button state:

### Theme

To add these Textures properties (found in `TextureButton`) to the `Button` node, create a new `Theme` resource and attach it to the `Button`. In the property inspector tab (with `Button` selected), go to `Theme` -> `New Theme`. If you intend to re-use this on other nodes (and not just this `Button`), then also "Save As" this theme.

Regardless of whether or not the Theme is saved as a re-usable file or kept embedded in the scene, this is where to look next (i.e. new "Theme" tab in dock of Godot editor):
