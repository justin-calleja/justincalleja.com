  This is a sample post to see how styling looks for different elements of a blog post
  e.g. headers, bullet lists etcâ€¦
  It will appear in the blog entries at development time, but not once the site is built.

## TLDR

If your custom type is:

```ts
class ImaCustom {
  constructor(public s: Set<string>, public a: string[]) {}
}
```

### Heading 3

- Any existing values in `content.exclude` which are not present in `filePaths` should not be in `result.exclude`
  - This is a sub item
- Any existing values in `content.include` which are not present in `filePaths` should not be in `result.include`
  - This is a sub item
    - This is another sub item
- Any existing values in `content.include` which are in `filePaths` are kept in the same order in `result.include`
  - this is using spaces
    - also using spaces
      - this one is with tabs
        - hello

#### Heading 4

I guess you already know what property based testing is if you're here. Recently, I was testing somethingâ€¦ which tbh, I didn't really know how I wanted to work. But in my mind, I could think of certain properties; certain things which had to hold on the datastructure in question when this operation happens. So - I figured I'd reach for that testing approach I know about; think is amazing; but almost never actually use ðŸ¤”

Anyway - it didn't take long to find [fast-check](https://github.com/dubzzz/fast-check#readme). I had used [jsverify](https://github.com/jsverify/jsverify) before, but I've forgotten the API and who cares anyway - I just want to code a few properties and get on with my appâ€¦ maybe actually get it to a usable state ðŸ˜…

Soâ€¦Â I'm searching online:

> Ye, I know more or less what property based testing is. Great - first few examples show how to generate basic types. Cool, found the list of built-inâ€¦ oh "arbitraries" they're calledâ€¦ hmm fancy that - and I thought I had an arbitrary name. Now if I could only get to the "how to generate your own flippin' types" in the documentation and give these stressed eyeballs a break.
